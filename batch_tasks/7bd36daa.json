We should try to stay away from danger and learn how to protect ourselves.\nOn our way to school, we should follow the traffic rules. For example, never listen to music while riding a bike. Besides, we should always follow the traffic lights while crossing the road. At school, running after each other in the classroom can be dangerous. We should also remember to protect ourselves while doing sports. When we’re at home alone, we shouldn’t play with fire. It’s too dangerous.
